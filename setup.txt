- A Centos 8 Desktop is required.
- Podman and Buildah exist. Learner installs Skopeo.
- Run sudo visudo and add /usr/local/bin to secure_path. Enable password-
  less sudo for the wheel group.

- Install Codeready Containers and download the pull secret.
  Copy the crc tool to /usr/local/bin.
  As normal user, run crc setup followed by crc start (pull secrect required).
  Count 3 minutes altogether.
  Copy the last few lines of the crc start output to a file crc-access. The 
  kubeadmin password is particularly important.
  The SSH key for logging onto the CRC VM is ~/.crc/machines/crc/id_ecdsa.

- Install virt-manager
- Download the smallest Centos 8 ISO and use it to create a VM with 4G RAM, 
  30G disk.
  Use simple partition setup (no LVM), install the most basic OS, set 
  IP Address to 192.168.122.21, create a user student, set both root and student
  passwords to pw.

- Create a simple NFS server on the Desktop.
     $ sudo mkdir /srv/volumes
     $ sudo chmod 777 /srv/volumes
     $ echo "/srv/volumes     *(rw)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
     $ cat /etc/exports
     $ sudo exportfs -va
     $ sudo systemctl enable nfs-server --now

- Install and start minikube.
- Install kubectl.

- Create an identity with ssh-keygen. Create .ssh/config with this content:
    host 192.168.122.21
        user student
    host 192.168.130.11
        user core
        IdentityFile $HOME/.crc/machines/crc/id_ecdsa
- Use ssh-copy-id to copy the new identity to the Centos 8 VM.

- Log on to the Centos 8 VM and install Docker.

- Log on to the CRC VM and modify the crio-wipe service. This is necessary
  so that the CRC VM survives rebooting after an unclean shutdown.
  Create /etc/systemd/system/crio-wipe.service with this content:
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unfortunately, CRI-O wipes its storage when starting after an unclean
# shutdown. This renders the CRC VM useless e.g. when the host reboots.
# As a workaround, this service is replaced by /bin/true.
# Original service at 
# /usr/lib/systemd/system/crio-wipe.service
[Unit]
Description=CRI-O Auto Update Script
Before=crio.service

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Run sudo systemctl daemon-reload and test it with systemctl cat crio-wipe.

- Stop all virtual machines: 
  - crc stop
  - minikube stop
  - sudo virsh shutdown c8-docker
